/*
From threads to executors

- Manually creating a Thread per task ties the what (the work) to the where (the thread). For a server with thousands
  of short tasks this is wasteful: the JVM cannot reuse threads, scheduling pressure is high, and you have to
  hand-write start/join lifecycle for every task.
- An Executor is the abstraction "submit work and let someone else manage how it runs". ExecutorService extends it
  with task submission that returns a Future, and lifecycle management (shutdown, awaitTermination).
- Once you have an ExecutorService, the only question becomes what kind — fixed pool, cached pool, scheduled pool,
  virtual-thread executor (Mod011), or a hand-tuned ThreadPoolExecutor.

    ExecutorService factory methods

    The Executors class provides ready-made executors:

    - newFixedThreadPool(N) — N permanent threads. Excess tasks queue. Predictable upper bound on resource usage; use
      when the workload is steady.
    - newCachedThreadPool() — unbounded; threads idle for 60s are reaped. Spikes turn into many threads; risky for
      unpredictable bursts.
    - newSingleThreadExecutor() — exactly one worker; serializes tasks. Good for "the dedicated thread that owns this
      resource" patterns.
    - newScheduledThreadPool(N) — adds schedule(...) and scheduleAtFixedRate(...).
    - newWorkStealingPool() — a ForkJoinPool (Mod008).
    - newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor() — one virtual thread per task (Mod011).

      silently. This is one of the most common sources of "missing logs": code submits a job, never inspects the

    Custom ThreadPoolExecutor

    - Construct directly when you need control beyond the Executors factories:
      new ThreadPoolExecutor(corePool, maxPool, keepAliveTime, unit, workQueue, threadFactory,
      rejectedExecutionHandler).
    - The interaction is subtle, and the order matters:
      1. While fewer than corePool threads exist, every new task creates a new thread — even if other threads are idle.
      2. Once corePool threads exist, new work goes onto the queue.
      3. Only when the queue is FULL do new threads spin up, to a maximum of maxPool.
      4. If the queue is full and maxPool is reached, the RejectedExecutionHandler decides what happens.
      Consequence: with an UNBOUNDED queue (the default of newFixedThreadPool) step 3 never fires, so maxPool is
      dead configuration and the queue grows without limit. Bounded queue + CallerRunsPolicy is the usual
      back-pressure recipe.
    - Built-in handlers: AbortPolicy (throws), CallerRunsPolicy (runs on the caller — gives back-pressure for free),
      DiscardPolicy, DiscardOldestPolicy.
    - Use a ThreadFactory to give threads meaningful names — this is the single most important thing you can do to
      make production thread dumps readable.
