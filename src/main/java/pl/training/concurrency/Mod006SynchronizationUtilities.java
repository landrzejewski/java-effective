    Semaphore

    - A Semaphore holds a non-negative count of permits. acquire() blocks until a permit is available and then takes
      one; release() returns one.
    - Use it to bound concurrent access to a finite resource: a connection pool of N connections, a printer that
      allows K simultaneous jobs, an outbound API that rate-limits to R parallel calls.
    - A semaphore with a single permit is essentially a non-reentrant mutex. Unlike a ReentrantLock, the same thread
      cannot re-acquire it without releasing first, and a permit can be released by a different thread than the one
      that acquired it — useful for hand-off patterns.
    - tryAcquire() is the non-blocking variant; tryAcquire(timeout, unit) waits at most the given time. Both should be
      paired with release() in finally.

      serving traffic", "wait for the start signal".

    CyclicBarrier

    - A CyclicBarrier(parties) makes parties threads wait for each other at a common point. Once they all arrive, the

    - Optional barrier action runs in one of the trip threads each round — useful for end-of-phase aggregation in
      iterative algorithms.
    - If any thread leaves the barrier abnormally (interrupt, timeout), the barrier becomes broken and other parties
      get BrokenBarrierException. Call reset() to put it back in a usable state.

    Phaser

    - Phaser generalises both CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier:

      advance.
    - A party can drop out without breaking the rest by calling arriveAndDeregister.
    - Override onAdvance(phase, registeredParties) to inject a barrier action and to terminate the phaser when it
      returns true.
    - Use Phaser when the number of participants varies between phases (e.g., recursion-style parallel decompositions,
      multi-stage pipelines with optional stages).
