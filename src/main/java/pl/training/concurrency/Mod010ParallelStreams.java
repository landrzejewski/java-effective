    Sequential vs parallel

    - A sequential stream processes elements one at a time on the calling thread.
    - A parallel stream splits the data across multiple threads, processes the chunks independently, and combines the
      partial results.
    - The demo below runs the SAME pipeline shape over the SAME data twice, changing only how much work each element
      costs. Cheap work: parallel loses. Costly work: parallel wins roughly in proportion to the core count. That
      single variable — per-element cost — decides more than anything else you can tune.
    - Two ways to ask for parallelism: collection.parallelStream() or collection.stream().parallel(). Both produce the
      same kind of stream.
    - Going parallel is not free — there is split, schedule, and combine overhead. The win comes only when the
      per-element work is large enough to outweigh that overhead, and the data structure can be split efficiently.
    - Every timing printed in this module is an ILLUSTRATION OF AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, not a benchmark. A single
      timed run on a cold JIT systematically flatters whichever variant runs second, so each measurement below is
      preceded by a warm-up. For numbers you would act on, use JMH.

    When parallel pays off

    - Trivial per-element work (a single arithmetic op): parallel is almost always slower because the constant

    - Heavy per-element work (parsing, hashing, decryption): parallel scales near-linearly with cores up to the
      parallelism limit.
    - Variable per-element work: work-stealing inside the fork-join pool absorbs imbalance, so parallel can still win
      even if elements have wildly different costs.

    collect and concurrent collectors

    - collect(Collectors.toList()) on a parallel stream still gives correct results, but the collector merges
      per-thread accumulators sequentially, which limits speedup.
    - A concurrent collector (toConcurrentMap, groupingByConcurrent) writes into a single shared concurrent
      container, skipping the merge step. It must also be marked UNORDERED (or used on an unordered stream) so the
      runtime is free to write into the container in any order.
    - "Skipping the merge" sounds like a free win. It is not, and the folklore that groupingByConcurrent is the
      faster choice on multi-core machines does not survive measurement. Two costs work against it:
      - Contention. Every worker writes into one shared ConcurrentHashMap. With few keys they all hammer the same
        handful of bins and serialise on them; the run below is roughly 40x SLOWER than plain groupingBy.
      - Accumulator cost. groupingBy builds a plain HashMap per chunk, and a parallel stream only produces about
        `parallelism` chunks — so the merge it "saves" is a couple of dozen cheap map unions, while every single
        element pays the higher price of a concurrent write.
    - The measurements below sweep key cardinality from 5 to a few thousand, plus an expensive downstream collector.
      On a typical machine groupingByConcurrent loses every one of them.
    - Practical rule: default to groupingBy. Reach for groupingByConcurrent only when a profiler shows the merge
      step itself is the bottleneck — very high cardinality combined with downstream containers that are costly to
      combine — and then confirm with a measurement on your data, not on this advice.
