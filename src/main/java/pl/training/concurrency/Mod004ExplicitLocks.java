When NOT to use explicit locks

- For a thread-safe map: prefer ConcurrentHashMap (Mod005). The library already does fine-grained locking internally
  and exposes atomic compound operations (compute, merge, computeIfAbsent).
- For coordination of independent counters: prefer LongAdder / AtomicInteger (Mod002) — no lock at all.
- For producer–consumer: prefer a BlockingQueue (Mod005). The queue subsumes the locking and the condition signalling.
- For coordinating a fan-out of tasks: prefer StructuredTaskScope (Mod012). It makes cancellation and aggregation
  explicit instead of hidden in a lock protocol.

A good rule of thumb: reach for an explicit lock only when no higher-level abstraction in java.util.concurrent covers
the case. The library version is almost always faster and easier to reason about.

    The optimistic-read idiom: snapshot the fields into locals, THEN validate.

      richer.
    - The mandatory shape is lock(); try { ... } finally { unlock(); }. If you forget the finally, an exception in the
      critical section leaks the lock and every other thread blocks forever.
    - Pros over synchronized: timeout, interruptible acquisition, multiple condition queues per lock, fairness, and
      rich introspection (getOwner, getQueuedThreads, getQueueLength).
    - Cons: more verbose; failure to call unlock is silent; you cannot use try-with-resources directly. In practice,

    StampedLock and optimistic reads

    - StampedLock (Java 8+) provides three modes: write, read, and optimistic read. Each lock/unlock returns a long
      stamp used to release or validate.
    - Optimistic read: call tryOptimisticRead(), snapshot the fields, then call validate(stamp). If no writer has
      acquired the lock in between, your snapshot is consistent and you skipped the read-lock cost entirely. Otherwise
      you fall back to the conventional readLock().
    - StampedLock is not reentrant and does not support Condition. Treat it as a high-performance specialist for
      read-mostly hot paths, not a drop-in replacement for ReentrantReadWriteLock.
    - tryConvertToWriteLock(stamp) lets you upgrade a read stamp to a write stamp without releasing first; it can
      return 0 if conversion is impossible, in which case you release and acquire the write lock conventionally.
    - Hard rule for optimistic reads: the body between tryOptimisticRead() and validate() runs with NO lock held,
      so it may only copy plain fields into local variables. Never call into a data structure that is not itself
      safe under concurrent mutation — validate() tells you afterwards that your snapshot was dirty, which is too
      late if the read has already thrown or looped forever.
