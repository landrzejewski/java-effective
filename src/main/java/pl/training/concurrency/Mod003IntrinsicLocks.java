// =================================================================================================

/*
## The intrinsic lock (monitor)

- Every Java object has an associated **intrinsic lock** (a *monitor*). Acquiring
that monitor is the only thing the `synchronized` keyword does.
- A monitor is binary: at most one thread holds it at any moment. Other threads
that try to acquire it wait in the BLOCKED state.
- Holding a monitor establishes a happens-before edge: changes made under one
acquire/release of monitor `m` are visible to any thread that subsequently acquires
`m`. This is the visibility half of synchronization.
- Releasing the monitor happens automatically when the synchronized block exits —
even via an exception. There is no way to forget to unlock an intrinsic monitor.
*/

// =================================================================================================
// Section 2: synchronized blocks vs methods
// =================================================================================================

/*
## synchronized blocks vs methods

- `synchronized` on an instance method acquires the monitor of `this`. On a static
method, it acquires the monitor of the *class object* (`MyClass.class`). These are
two different monitors.
- A `synchronized (obj) { ... }` block lets you choose any object as the monitor.
This gives finer granularity than method-level synchronization and is the modern
recommendation: the lock object is named, the protected region is small, and you
can use multiple monitors to break contention.
- Lock objects should be `private final` and have a single purpose. Never lock on
public objects (`String` literals, boxed integers, the class itself in a public
API) — anyone can lock the same object and accidentally deadlock with you.
*/

// =================================================================================================
// Section 3: Reentrancy
// =================================================================================================

/*
## Reentrancy

- Java intrinsic locks are **reentrant**: the same thread can re-acquire a monitor
it already holds. The JVM tracks an acquisition count and only releases the
monitor after the matching number of exits.
- Without reentrancy, a synchronized method calling another synchronized method
on the same object would deadlock with itself. With it, recursion and helper-method
chains are safe.
- All `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock` implementations are reentrant for the same
reason.
*/

// =================================================================================================
// Section 4: wait, notify, notifyAll
// =================================================================================================

/*
## wait, notify, notifyAll

- `Object.wait()` releases the monitor and parks the calling thread on the
object's *wait set*. The thread can only call `wait()` while it actually holds
the monitor — otherwise it gets `IllegalMonitorStateException`.
- Another thread holding the same monitor calls `notify()` to wake **one** waiter
or `notifyAll()` to wake **all** of them. The waiters then have to re-acquire the
monitor before returning from `wait()`.
- A typical scaffold:
```java
synchronized (lock) {
    while (!condition) lock.wait();
    // ... act on the condition, then notify if appropriate
    lock.notifyAll();
}
```
- `notify` wakes an arbitrary waiter; `notifyAll` wakes all of them. Use
`notifyAll` whenever multiple threads might be waiting on different conditions on
the same monitor — picking only one of them can cause missed signals.
*/

// =================================================================================================
// Section 5: The while-not-if rule
// =================================================================================================

/*
## The while-not-if rule

- A wait must always be re-tested in a `while` loop, never an `if`. Reasons:
  1. **Spurious wakeups** — the JVM is allowed to wake a waiting thread even if no
     one called `notify`. The condition might still be false.
  2. **Stolen wakeups** — between `notify` and re-acquisition of the monitor,
     another thread can change the state, so the condition that was true at notify
     time might be false again when our thread runs.
- Therefore: re-evaluate the predicate after each `wait()` returns. The cost of an
extra evaluation is far below the cost of a subtle bug.
*/

// =================================================================================================
// Section 6: Producer–consumer with monitor
// =================================================================================================

/*
## Producer–consumer with monitor

- The bounded buffer pattern: producers `put` items, consumers `take` items, the
buffer has a maximum capacity.
- One monitor (the buffer's intrinsic lock) protects access; producers wait while
the buffer is full and consumers wait while it is empty. Both sides call
`notifyAll` after every change because the same monitor serves two predicates
("not full" and "not empty").
- This is the canonical example for `wait/notifyAll`. In real code today you would
use a `BlockingQueue` (Mod005) or a `ReentrantLock` with two `Condition`s
(Mod004), both of which are simpler.

// Section 7: Limitations of the intrinsic lock
// =================================================================================================

/*
## Limitations of the intrinsic lock

- **No tryLock** — you cannot ask "is the monitor available, or shall I do
something else?". Threads can only block.
- **No timeout** — there is no `wait until lock available for at most 100 ms`.
- **No interruptible acquisition** — a thread blocked on entering a synchronized
block ignores interrupts. Once it gets in, it can be interrupted while in `wait`,
but not while it is waiting to acquire the monitor.
- **A single condition queue** — every monitor has exactly one wait set. If you
need separate "not full" and "not empty" queues you must use `notifyAll` and
re-check, or move to `ReentrantLock` with multiple `Condition`s.
- **No fairness** — the order in which queued threads acquire the monitor is
unspecified. Long-running threads can starve.
- **Less observability** — no `getOwner()`, `getQueuedThreads()`, etc.

These limitations motivate `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock` covered in
Mod004.
