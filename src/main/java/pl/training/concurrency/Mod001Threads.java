What is a thread

- A process is an isolated unit of execution managed by the operating system, with its own address space and resources.
- A thread is the smallest unit the operating system can schedule. Multiple threads share the address space of the
  process they belong to: heap, loaded classes, file descriptors, etc.
- Every JVM starts with one foreground thread named main. The JVM exits when all non-daemon threads have terminated.
- Threads enable concurrency (progress on multiple tasks logically at once) and parallelism (actual simultaneous
  execution on multiple CPU cores).
- The JVM exposes platform threads as a thin wrapper over OS threads. They are preemptively scheduled by the OS — your
  code does not control when a context switch happens, so any shared state read or written without synchronization can
  be observed in arbitrary order.

    Creating threads

    - The idiomatic way to define a task is to implement Runnable (or Callable<V> if the task returns a value) and pass
      it to a Thread. This separates what the task does from how it is run.
    - Subclassing Thread and overriding run() is legal but discouraged: it couples the task with the thread, prevents
      extending another class, and confuses readers about the lifetime of the task.
    - Java 21 added a fluent builder via Thread.ofPlatform(). It supports .name(...), .daemon(...), .priority(...),
      and .start(Runnable). There is also Thread.ofVirtual() for virtual threads — covered in Mod011VirtualThreads.
    - A Thread instance can be started exactly once. Calling start() on an already started thread throws
      IllegalThreadStateException.

    Cooperative cancellation (the interrupt protocol)

      blocking calls (sleep, wait, join, queue operations) — both are signals to wind down.
    - Thread.interrupted() is a static method that clears the flag while isInterrupted() does not. Use interrupted()
