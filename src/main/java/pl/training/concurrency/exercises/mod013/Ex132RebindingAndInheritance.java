        //    the value lives as long as the child thread does.
        //  - A ScopedValue binding is ONE immutable node that parent and children SHARE. Adding a sub-task is
        //    O(1) and copies nothing, the view is always consistent because nobody can mutate the node, and the
        //    binding is unwound automatically when the enclosing block exits.
