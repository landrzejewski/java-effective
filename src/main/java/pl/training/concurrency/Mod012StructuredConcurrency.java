Mental model

The shape of a structured fan-out:

parent task                      open scope ─┐
  │                                          │
  ├─ fork sub-task A (virtual thread)        │ all children's lifetimes
  ├─ fork sub-task B (virtual thread)        │ are bounded by the scope
  ├─ fork sub-task C (virtual thread)        │
  │                                          │
  └─ scope.join()  ←──── waits for all ──────┘
       (or until the joiner short-circuits)

Closing the scope (try-with-resources) cancels any still-running children. If the parent itself is cancelled
(because its parent scope cancelled it), the cancellation propagates downwards. The whole tree is structurally
enclosed — there are no orphans.

API note (Java 26)

StructuredTaskScope is still a preview API in Java 26 (JEP 505 lineage), and the Joiner API changed relative to
Java 25 — the examples below use the Java 26 shape:

  Java 25                                    Java 26

    /*
    The unstructured-concurrency problem

    - A CompletableFuture chain that fans out to N services has no enclosing "task" object. Each branch lives
      independently:
      - If one branch throws, the others keep running and continue to consume threads, sockets, DB rows.
      - Cancelling one future does not propagate; siblings cannot be told to stop.
      - Stack traces of inner stages do not point back to the call site that submitted them — they show the executor
        worker, period.
    - This pattern leaks resources and makes failure handling fragile. Structured concurrency attaches a
      parent–child relationship between a coordinating task and its sub-tasks, so the lifetime of the children is
      bounded by the lifetime of the parent.
    - Note the latch below: we must wait until the first task has actually STARTED before cancelling it. Without
      that, cancel() can win the race against the pool and the task never runs at all — which would look like
      cancellation working, the exact opposite of the point being made.

      Reading subtask.get() before scope.join() returns is illegal.
    - The no-argument open() is shorthand for open(Joiner.awaitAllSuccessfulOrThrow()): it waits for every subtask
      and throws StructuredTaskScope.FailedException if any of them failed. join() itself returns null (Void), so
      you read the individual results from the Subtask handles — which is exactly what you want when the sub-tasks
      have DIFFERENT result types, as in a dashboard.
    - The try-with-resources close() makes sure that even if join() is skipped (e.g., an exception jumps over it),
      every still-running subtask is cancelled before the try block exits.
    - Each fork creates a virtual thread by default — see §9.

      ---------------------------- ------------------------------- ----------------------------
      Fan-out / fan-in             allOf + join() per branch       fork + join()
      Cancellation propagation     NO (Mod009 §9)                  YES — sibling-aware
      Deadline for the whole job   per-stage orTimeout only        Configuration.withTimeout
      Exception aggregation        manual                          automatic via joiner
      Stack traces                 severed at executor boundary    preserved (synchronous shape)
      Best for                     event-driven, callbacks         request-bounded fan-out
