/*
The work-stealing model

- A ForkJoinPool keeps each worker thread's tasks in a private deque.
- Workers push new sub-tasks on top of their own deque (LIFO — best for cache locality) and pop from the top when
  they need work.
- When a worker's deque empties, it steals a task from the bottom of another worker's deque (FIFO — the oldest,
  biggest piece). The asymmetry keeps stealing cheap and avoids contention with the owner.
- For divide-and-conquer workloads (recursive splits, balanced trees, embarrassingly parallel data), work-stealing
  fills cores well even when split sizes are uneven.

    RecursiveTask<V> (with result)

    - Subclass RecursiveTask<V> for parallel reductions that compute and return a value.
    - Same divide-and-conquer skeleton, but compute() returns a V and the parent combines the children's values.
    - Use the canonical pattern below: fork() the first child to run async, then compute() the second on the current
      thread, then join() the first. This is one fewer fork than fork(); fork(); join(); join(); (the simpler-looking
      pattern) and avoids one wasted thread switch.

    fork vs compute vs invoke

    - fork() schedules the task on the current pool's deque and returns immediately. Use it on at most N-1 of N
      children — the last child is more efficient as a compute() because it stays on the current thread (no enqueue,
      no steal).
    - compute() runs the task synchronously on the current thread. It is the body of the recursion.
    - invoke() is fork() followed by join() — synchronous from the caller's perspective.
    - invokeAll(t1, t2, ...) is the convenient form for RecursiveAction. For results, prefer the explicit
      fork() + compute() + join() pattern.

      - The per-element cost is non-trivial (microseconds, not nanoseconds).
